# Bank-Note-Analysis

I'm Using Machine learning to predict wheter the bank note as fake or genuine.The dataset contain 1372 rows and 5 columns.I will be using different algorithms such as Logistic regression, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest Classifier and KNearest Neighbor classifier.After building the algorithm also use cross_val_score together with confusion matrix and using GridSearchCV in KNN classifier and  the accuracy score to see how well model is doing.
